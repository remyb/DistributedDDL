======== Welcome to DistributedDDL =============
by Remy and Kevin for ICS 421 - Database Systems
================================================

Intro:
Distributed is a program to learn about how
distributed database systems work.  It parses a
config of nodes (databases) including a catalog
that stores records of transactions.  The tran-
actions are processed using threads.

Todo:
Currently DistributedDDL does not employ a proper
SQL grammer parser.  This will be a feature of
the next version.  We are currently looking at
SQLParser but that decision may change after some
further research into this topic.

Instructions:

config.cfg - This file is required and must be in
the standard ini format used with Python's ConfigParser
in the standard library.  The file can be named anything
but must end with the *cfg* extension.  

ddl - You may enter any DDL's for DistributedDDL to
process.  This file does not have any specific on its
name.  The syntax should be one query per line.  When
SQL grammer is brought into this project at the next 
release more complicated queries will be allowed. 

Run:

1)  chmod +x main.py; ./main.py ddl.txt config.cfg

OR

2) python main.py ddl.txt config.cfg

For now the order is important.  Next release flags will
be used to distinguish between other arguments.
